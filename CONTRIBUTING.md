Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

This repository is open to improvements such as bug fixes, documentation updates, and refactoring.

## Code of Conduct
By participating, you agree to follow the rules in **[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/Zevhys/quickCart-server?tab=coc-ov-file)**.

## How to Contribute

1. **[Open an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) first** — especially for anything bigger than a typo.
   Let's make sure we're on the same page before you spend time coding.

2. **[Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo), make your changes, then [open a PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).**
   Keep it small and focused — one thing per PR makes reviewing much easier.

3. **Describe what you changed and why** in your PR description.
   Bonus points if you mention how you tested it!
